modify the not null property in SQL table is:-
alter table table_name modify column_name varchar(200) not null;

Modify the default property of column in  mySql is :-
alter table table_name alter column column_name set default "desired_input";

auto increment key which can be used for setting the primary key automatically:
create table Student( id int primary key auto_increment,
name varchar(200) not null default "vivek",);

ALias is used to change the name of the column on our desired output
select name as NAme , email as EmailId from table_name;

String Function in the Sql :
concat(firstname,lastname);
select concat("vivek","kumar","verma")
select concat(name,email,address) from Students;


Finding the distinct elements from the table or column the query is:-
select distinct firstname, lastname from the tablename;

LIKE keyword:-
Like keyword is used to extract the values which have the matching words given in %keyword%;
select * from tableName where column_name like "%viv%";
if we want to find all the names or data whose length is n then we have to use n whitespaces;
select * from students where name like "___"; select first_name from students where first_name like "___";
query to select where first name starts with A;
select first_name from students where first_name like "A%";
query where first name ends with A:
select first_name from students where first_name like "%A";

LIMIT KEYWORD:-
Limit keyword is used to limit the number of results;
select * from table_name limit 3 :- this is used to pick top 3 results
select first_name from students limit n1,n2:- This is used to pick n2 results starting from the range n1;

nth highest salary:-
select first_name from students order by salary desc limit 1;


COUNT FUNCTION :-
most powerful function in sql 
1: count(*) it is used to count all the rows in a table regardless of the null values 
 select count(*) from students;

2: count(cloumn_name) it is used to count all the rows where the column has non null values;
 select count(first_name) from students;
3: count(distinct cloumn_name):- It is used to count all the rows with distinct values
 select count(distinct first_name) from students;
 select count(*) from students where dob>"2000-04-
13";


GROUP BY FUNCTION:-


Min and MAx function :-
select max(fees) from students;
select min(fees) from students;
SUB QUERIES FOR MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM QUERIES:
select first_name from students where fees=(select max(fees) from students);
select first_name from students where fees=(select mIN(fees) from students);

min and max functions are also used with the strings column which are sorted in a lexicographically order 
 select min(first_name) from students;

SUM AND AVG function in mysql:-
select sum(fees) from students;
select avg(fees) from students;
Question 1) if we wants to find the sum or avg of salary of defferent departments then we can use 
Select department sum(salary) from students group by department;
 select dob, sum(fees) from students group by dob; 

DECIMAL DATA TYPES:
the decimal data type is used to create data type that takes the defined number of inputs
score decimal(n1,n2): - This means the score contains n1-n2 digits before the decimal and n2 digits after the decimal;
floats :- it can take 7 digits of integer and 4 bytes of memory
double :- it can take 15 digits of integer and 8 bytes of memory
defining the data in the table is:-
create table vivek(f float, d decimal); 

DATE AND TIME 
FORMAT : YEAR:MONTH:DATE:
TIME:  HOUR:MINTUE: SECONDS:
create table samay (t time , d date);
insert into samay("10:10:10", "2003-09-01");

CURR DATE AND CURR TIME :-
select curdate();
select curtime();
select now();
insert into samay values(curtime(), curdate());

getting dayname , day of week and day of month
select dayname("2003-09-04");  this gives sun,mon,sat etc;
select dayofmonth("2003-09-04"); this gives 09 to 12;
select dayofweek("2003-09-09"); this gives 0 to 7 as a output;
select d, dayname(d) from samay;
select d, monthname(d) from samay;

It prints the difference of dates between the two dates select datediff("2003-09-04","2004-09-03");
it add the number of days in the current date 🧑‍💻 select date_add("2003-09-09", interval 65 day);
it subtract the number of days in the current date 💻 select date_sub("2003-09-09", interval 65 day);
💻 select date_add(curdate(), interval 15 day);
💻 select timediff("10:10:10","09:09:09");

🎖️  DEFAULT AND updated_time when we will add it will add the defaul current time and when we update it then it will also update the timing of that content
💻 mysql> CREATE TABLE blogs (
    ->     blog VARCHAR(140),
    ->     ct DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    ->     ut DATETIME ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    -> );
